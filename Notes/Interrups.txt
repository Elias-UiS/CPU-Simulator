Interrupt Vector Table (IVT)
Is a map of codes, and the corresponding "Address" for the function which is stored in memory.
The cpu checks this and use this pointer for the fetching.
I will not do this.
The cpu stores the current registers inside the kernel stack which is a per process memory location.
And uses that to store them into the pcb.
